#What algorithm have you used to create a maze?
-- The algorithm I chose to generate the maze is Primms Algorithm. For this assignment, I decided to set the coordinate for the first maze cell to be (0,0).

#What makes it random and dynamic?
-- The maze starts to grow cell by cell from (0,0) - the origin at random direction.

#How have you tracked the path solving it? 
-- I did not tracked the path. I solved the maze recursively after generating.
 
#Why have you chosen pre-existing assets over making something yourself? Make sure to cite any sources for assets, code or otherwise, so we're sure you're not claiming you've done a 4K realistic texture of grass on your own.
-- Yes. Since this assignment is my first Unity project. I have watched the following tutorials for code references:
    1. Brackeys. How to make a Video Game in Unity - BASICS(E01-E10).

#Any challenges you found in the assignment?
-- Yes. It is my first time to code in Unity and C#. The initial process is a bit hard.
